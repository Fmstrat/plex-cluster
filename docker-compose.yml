  # The service that sychronizes the Plex servers. It takes the API calls
  # from plex-cluster-proxy, and reaches out to any other configured Plex
  # servers to set their status just as if the client connecting to the

  #
  # You will want to secure this behind an SSL proxy in the real world.
  #
  # There is only ever one of these.
